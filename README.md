- 👋 Hi, I’m Olu'tomi Owoeye (or Olu'atomi, if you prefer).
- 👀 I’m interested in web development. And oh! I got obseessed with buiding GUIs off late.
- 🌱 I’m sort of an in-the-middle Python programmer; not beginner, and not quite an expert.
- 💞️ I’m currently working on an app to help automate some school stuff.
- 📫 If you like me, reach me by Mail at oluwatomilayoowoeye.oio@gmail.com
